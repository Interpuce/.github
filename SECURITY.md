# Security

We are going to make our projects the most secure on the world. If you find the bug in our project read this section to get help with reporting it.

## If it isn't the security vulnerability use Github Issues

This is the best place to report the bugs which aren't the security vulnerabilities. We check them every day and we will fix it.

## Reporting a security vulnerability
